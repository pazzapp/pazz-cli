Pazz is a deterministic password manager.

Like 1Password or Lastpass it lets you use different passwords for different websites. Unlike the above however there is no need to trust an external party, or store any kind of file or 'vault' as the passwords are generated on the fly each time you look them up.

This means you can't choose your own passwords, but also that you'll never lose you passwords so long as you remember your master password.
